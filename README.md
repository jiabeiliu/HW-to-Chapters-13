1) What is JDBC?
JDBC, short for Java Database Connectivity, is an API (Application Programming Interface) provided by Java that allows database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases. The JDBC API enables Java applications to execute SQL statements, thus allowing interaction with any SQL-compliant database.

JDBC plays a crucial role in the development of Java-based data access applications and supports basic data operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying database records. It provides a set of interfaces and classes written in Java.

Key components of JDBC include:

DriverManager: This class manages a list of database drivers. It matches connection requests from the application with the proper database driver using communication subprotocols.
Connection: This interface provides methods for contacting a database. The connection object represents a session between Java applications and a database.
Statement: It's used to execute a SQL query. The Statement object represents a static SQL statement.
PreparedStatement: This extends Statement with more efficiency, security, and ease of use if you need to execute parameterized SQL statements.
ResultSet: This represents the set of results from a SQL query. It allows the Java application to iterate over the results returned by the query.
2) How to connect your Java program to a database?
Connecting a Java program to a database using JDBC involves several steps:

Include JDBC Library: Ensure that the JDBC driver for your database is included in your project's classpath. If you're using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, add the dependency for your database's JDBC driver in your project's build file.

Load JDBC Driver: This step is optional from Java 6 onwards due to the introduction of the JDBC 4.0 API, which includes automatic loading of JDBC drivers. However, in older versions or for certain drivers, you may need to load the driver class by calling Class.forName("com.example.DriverClassName").

Establish a Connection: Create a connection to the database using DriverManager.getConnection(). You'll need to provide a JDBC URL, which typically includes the type of database, the database server address, and the database name, along with a username and password if required.

java
String url = "jdbc:subprotocol://hostname:port/dbname";
String username = "yourUsername";
String password = "yourPassword";
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
Execute SQL Statements: Create a Statement or PreparedStatement object from the Connection object to execute SQL commands. You can use these objects to execute queries (SELECT statements) or updates (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements).

Process the Results: For queries, the executeQuery() method of Statement or PreparedStatement returns a ResultSet object. Use this object to iterate through the results.

Close the Resources: It's vital to close all database-related resources such as ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects once you're done with them to free up database connections and resources.

Here's a simple example of connecting to a database and executing a query:

java
try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
     Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM yourTable")) {
    while (rs.next()) {
        // Process result set
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
This process outlines the basic steps for connecting a Java application to a database using JDBC, executing SQL statements, and processing results.
